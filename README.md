#PupilPod
##Management Information System **MIS 2.0**
###Evelina Hospital School

This is a second version of a pupil management system created for the school be Will Evans of Fractal Web Designs (Bristol). Built in CakePHP 2.3 this second version includes:

- Responsive design
- Multi-pupil processing *staff can add session notes to many pupils on one form*
- Better Registers *view and edit whole classes, page through weeks
- Auto email function completed *return attendance to schools via email
- Target module added
- Curriculum tree added *organise lesson plans by Keystage and subject pick and add to many pupils
- Reports orgainised by subject

I appologise in advance for my very wet (not DRY) scruffy paper2.css file. And I abandoned the Cake way of marking up SQL queries. I know how to write SQL so for the more tricky statements I have just written it my self.
